<h2> About Me</h2>
<p>My interest in web development began the first time I accidentally hit the view source option online. Seeing the list of indecipherable text and finding out that someone had written that and in so doing set up a website was immediately impressive!</p>
<h3> My interests include</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Developing websites that are intuitive for the technically challenged and usable by the differently abled</a>
  <li>Incorporating web development with my love(s) of teaching and writing</li>
<li>DND</li>
  </ul>
