<h2> About Me</h2>
<p>My interest in web development began the first time I accidentally hit the view source option online. Seeing the list of indecipherable text and finding out that someone had written that and in so doing set up a website was immediately impressive! Once I have successfully completed the Thinkful Bootcamp program, I look forward to collaborating with others </p>
